# Unresponsive Node.js Server Due to Long Request

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a long-running request can block the server, making it unresponsive to subsequent requests.  The example uses a `setTimeout` function to simulate a 5-second delay, but this could represent any long-running operation like database queries or file processing.

**Problem:** The server becomes unresponsive for the duration of the 5-second delay.  Any requests received during that time will be pending until the initial request completes.

**Solution:**  This is addressed by using techniques like clustering, worker threads, or asynchronous operations to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main event loop.
